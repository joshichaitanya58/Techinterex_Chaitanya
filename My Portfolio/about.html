        <p>My name is Chaitanya Joshi. I am a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong interest in building
            user-friendly and responsive websites. I enjoy working with technologies like HTML, CSS, and PHP, and I
            constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge by learning new tools and frameworks. My goal is to
            create seamless digital experiences that not only look great but also function efficiently across all
            devices. Currently, Iâ€™m working on several hands-on projects including personal portfolio websites and
            interactive web applications, which help me sharpen my development skills and bring creative ideas to life..
